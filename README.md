# React forward refs

Complete the App.js and InputField.js file using <code>forward refs</code>  concept in the <code>InputField.js</code>  file. You have to write the function settingValue in <code>App.js</code>  such that it copies the text from inputField having id <code>#input </code> and paste to textArea having id <code>#textarea</code>  as shown in video. The second function is focusInput which changes focus on Input field with id <code>#input . The useRef is define in App.js file and then forwarded into InputField.js file using forward refs concept.
You should make sure that the tags having ids <code>#input, <code>#settingValueButton</code> ,<code>#focusInputButton</code> , <code>#textarea</code> , <code>#input </code> are properly visible on the screen .
Also make sure that when button with id settingValueButton is clicked the value if InputField appears in the TextArea and when button with id focusInputButton the InputField with id input becomes focussed.
